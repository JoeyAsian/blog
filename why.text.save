gaiuohkjncjanoihbnfealmdoajcipn lignakl; ipdoibnThe reason i still come to this class and signed up for the class is because even before I even heard of the class I was going to sign up for a online coding class. I knew that programming is a big industry and there is a lot to learn so i thought that taking the class will for 1. give me experience and learn things, 2. see if i actually like coding/programming.
If I do enjoy programming i will like to make money and im kinda doing this just for money so yea
LOL POOP
