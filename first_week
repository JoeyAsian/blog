	The first week of the coding camp was kind of tough because of the schedule. My sleep schedule had to change which i was sad about, and i have football practice right after so i have no
free time at all. The first day was terrible because the rich guy was going way too in depth into things that we are not even doing. All of us admit to thinking about quiting because of the first day. I remember thinking that this was not an entry level cource at all. 
	
	The second day was alright, we got to meet Roger and he was really cool. He is helpful and friendly towards every student. He doesn't go too fast during lectures and is willing to backtrack if you are stuck or missed a step.


	The last 3 days we started making a game on Scratch.com. My game had many issues and took a whole day to fix a simple background bug.
	
	All in all i would say that it was a succesfull week.
